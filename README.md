# BibTeX from URL

This an extension that is a modification to 

* <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bibtex-entry-from-url/mgpmgkhhbjgkpnanlmlhibjfgpdpgjec>
* <https://github.com/nettrino/BibtexFromUrl>

However we provide a different output format which is 

```
@misc{www-google,
   author = {},
   title = {Google},
   howpublished = {Web Page},
   url = {https://www.google.com},
   month = sep,
   year = 2019
}
```
 
For github entries it will look like 

```
@misc{www-cyberaide-chrome-bibtex,
   author = {},
   title = {Extension to chrome that creates bibtex entries from urls}, # description from github
   howpublished = {GitHub},
   url = {https://github.com/cyberaide/chrome-bibtex},
   month = sep,
   year = 2019
}
```
